<p>After checking out of my motel room, I am sitting in a relatively quiet courtyard in line of sight of two crows sitting in pine trees making their characteristic vocalizations. Crows are my favorite birds. My second favorite birds are red tail hawks. My third favorite birds are turkeys. All three of those birds seem to be native to the regions I frequent (especially in Dublin (California) and Fremont (California)). Yesterday while I was <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high on psilomethoxin</a> and laying on the floor of my motel room with the window fully opened and curtains obscuring the window such that daylight flooded in through the edges of the window in an eerie way, I heard the crows and smaller birds making vocalizations at times and felt comforted by those sounds. <span style="background:#ffff00">I was so high that I was in full &#8220;quantum mechanics&#8221; mode (i.e. thinking that the world outside that room was undefined until I observed it &#8220;in real time&#8221;). I imagined that I was in a movie set and the sounds of humans, birds, and car traffic outside was merely sound with no source designed to trick me into thinking that my memories of what the environment looked like outside that room was physically instantiated outside of that room even though I was not currently looking at it. I was so high that I felt that I was communing with humans from the future and that they were implicitly suggesting that I knew what was going on and just had to be a good sport about it and to not reveal to other humans in the past where I was supposed to be living as an actor from the future that I am part of a time-traveling agenda to usher humanity from the past where Karlina Ray Beringer the character is supposed to exist (starting in the year 1990) to the future where I was able to teleport to using the psychedelics to reveal how reality is fundamentally a personalized simulation for each locus of subjective experience (i.e. for each individual person).</span> It was like the architects of that movie set were subtly ridiculing me for taking so long to figure out what was going on (or that it has been a long time since I have been able to break out of the space-time continuum in which the character I have been assigned to play is supposed to be dwelling in the year 2023). Those architects seemed to be suggesting that I was lucid enough to alter the mechanics of my notion of reality and that nothing existed outside that room until I looked out the window or opened the door. I imagined that there was nothing but a blank white light outside of that motel room and that I was essentially in some kind of time machine which looked like the motel room Karlina Ray Beringer was renting on 11_FEBRUARY_2023 (but I was really in a place outside of that character&#8217;s convincingly rigid universe interacting with humans from at least fifty years after 2023). To paraphrase what those humans of the future sounded like, they seemed to be saying, &#8220;You are doing everything right. Otherwise you would not be here. The fact that anyone makes it to this level at all means that those people chose to arrive in your level and not some other level of existence. Just keep being a good example for the humans of 2023. Most of them have yet to catch up to you. Basically, what you are supposed to do as Karlina Ray Beringer in the year 2023 is continue doing what you do for a living while patiently waiting for the rest of human civilization to catch up.&#8221; I figured that Elon Musk might be one of the time-traveling visionaries and engineers helping to usher humanity into a relatively idyllic future. I imagine that there are limitlessly many space-time continuums a person could select at any point in that person&#8217;s individual solipsistic reality simulation and that a person&#8217;s reality is basically what they honestly prefer to manifest. I imagine that there exist space-time continuums in which Karlina Ray Beringer watches human civilization collapse as a result of pervasive warfare and ecological destruction and that Karlina Ray Beringer would be a witness in that particular space-time continuum to humanity going extinct in a violent and disappointing manner (but probably to Karlina&#8217;s liking if that is what Karlina chooses because that would be a version of Karlina who is tired of humanity and ready to incarnate as something other than human in the next lifespan). I seem to be choosing the version of Karlina who wants humanity to prevail to become an intergalactic, alien-communing, reality-bending wizard species which completely graduates from fossil fuels by 2040 and enables each human citizen to become at least as affluent and liberated as I am as a digital nomad and psychonaut inhabiting the Bay Area and treating it like the ultimate dream come true as a human in 2023. I do think that I live in the best part of Planet Earth in 2023 and that I am one of the luckiest humans in all existence thus far. In fact, I sort of feel like a &#8220;chosen one&#8221; who is tasked with helping to lead a revolution for the human species. That does not mean that I am the only &#8220;chosen one&#8221; but it does mean that I am probably more &#8220;woke&#8221; than the average human being is in my current location in the space-time continuum I am playing. Eventually, every human will have at least as much visionary potential as I do and be able to wield it such that real-life &#8220;sorcery&#8221; is commonplace. I imagine and hope that all human children will learn how to code and be proficient engineers by the time they are teenagers and that humans would live to realize their God-like potentials rather than to squander them by getting amnesia about such God-like potentials while living in a game in which they do little more than struggle to survive without questioning why because too much self awareness at that stage is too painful and destabilizing. I drew a diagram (i.e. choose_your_&#8221;ending&#8221;_reality_game.png) to accompany this text below which illustrates how I think The Game works: the loop represents a space-time continuum which stops evolving upwards towards higher levels of consciousness. A person who gets caught in a loop could stay there for quite a long time (perhaps multiple life-times). A person will seemingly keep going through the same cyclical pattern until that person is able to get enough deviant thoughts which create just enough wiggle room to notice alternatives and to, hence, escape that point of evolutionary stagnancy. I think that it is also possible for people who are super high level consciousness to travel back and forth through time without loosing their connection to where their preferred location is such that they can return home without getting lost and hence trapped somewhere in the past (or future).</p>
<p>Finally, I think that all imaginable space-time continuums exist immutably and eternally as elements of some indefinitely large set called the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTIVERSE</a>. What I (Karlina Ray Beringer) am is a piece of cosmic intelligence which decided that it wanted to survive indefinitely long and to evolve to become indefinitely advanced (in terms of intelligence and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGENCY</a>) rather than to end my character&#8217;s space-time continuum and identity at some point. If I choose to end the evolution of the character I am playing (i.e. the person who is writing this blog post and architecting <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>), then I imagine that, as soon as Karlina Ray Beringer dies and no longer reincarnates, that the consciousness (which is the fundamental substrate underlying all of reality) which was allocated to Karlina Ray Beringer will be freed up and, at that level of reality, there will be no more Karlina Ray Beringer imposing preferences on how to allocate that universal consciousness (but inside the annals of the multiverse there will presumably always be Karlina Ray Beringer living out its life (which is analogous to saying that, in a library containing all the books imaginable, there is a book in which a purple dragon is on a mission to save its homeland from gnorcs and every stage of that dragon&#8217;s journey is eternally preserved and, hence, indefinitely relivable)).</p>
